About Me

My name is Motuma Ayana. I am a Geographic Information Scientist with a specialization in Computer Science. 
As a group oriented individual passionate about community work, what sets me apart is how my diverse background influences my 
technical experience in developing connected and collaborative applications.

My passion for art and design was brought to life during my studies and internship experience on Web GIS and optimization. 
I was intrigued by the interactive and collaborative systems employed by companies and how they correlate with the development world. 
Simplicity is a powerful concept that is often difficult to grasp and the most successful projects should not be complex. 
From my experience, programing goes beyond just the algorithms: 
it is the art to simplify and organize code, creating the smallest derivative possible to appreciate the uniqueness it brings.

I currently am a freelance programmer, working on enhancing and transforming existing platforms, 
raising the bar for creativity, engagement and user-optimized pages. 
Web development programming is constantly changing and evolving and I hope to continue to explore imaginative techniques, 
to inspire, aid and bring the best possible work to my clients. 
In today's workspace and as an individual coming from a diverse background, 
I am a vital asset bringing in fresh and unique ideas to the table.
